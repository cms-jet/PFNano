  # If others shall be able to access dataset via DAS (important when collaborating for commissioning!)

  # do NOT submit too many tasks at the same time, despite it looking more convenient to you
  # wait for tasks to finish before submitting entire campaigns,
  # it's better to request one dataset at a time (taking fairshare into account)
